# Celebrating Prometheus 3.0

Whats new prometheus 3.0
Metrics-based mon itoring and alerting stack
* all the metric collection and storage
* query metrics and alerting
* Dashboarding

Whats new
* 4 main releases -2.51 to 2.55
* 1 LTS release - 2.45.5 to 2.45.6
* prometheus/alertmanager 0.28
 
new UI and UX
* built from ground up and very different
* query explainer: straight up what your query is doing

Native Histograms
* give you a good way to determine how something is behaving
* help you figure out what are the really slow queries
* new style is simpler
* native histograms in prometheus and open telemetry were made 100% the same

Remote Write 2.0
* pull based for a reason
* pulling data the write thing
* Talos(uh maybe a dif word maybe not talos) built around prometheus
* Completely overhauled Remote-write
* uses symbol training now

Using prometheus as your opentelemetry backend
* enable the OTLP reciever
* can push to prometheus
* problem with push could be out of order data

exposing format and quoting can use the same

Pull model gets you better properties. More upfront work.

Changes to alert manager
* support utf
* alerts with emjois 
* integrations with pajor duty and ops g and Slack v1 but not v2

new explain ux a plan to get that into grafana
